# Conventions

## Observed conventions

- **Language:** Bash for automation scripts, YAML for CI/CD workflows.
- **Naming:** Lowercase, kebab-case for files and directories; UPPER_CASE for env vars.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with reusable jobs; artifacts for certificate delivery.
- **Security:** Secrets stored in GitHub Secrets; `.gitignore` excludes `.pem` files; bot commits certificates.
- **Certificate:** ECDSA P-256 key type; DNS-01 validation via Cloudflare; auto-renewal via cron.

## Recommended conventions

- Use English for technical context when a project has mixed-language documentation; otherwise match the repository's predominant language.
- Keep files and resource names lowercase and descriptive; use the conventions already established by the adopted project.
- Prefer small, focused changes and document meaningful architectural choices in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Do not introduce cloud, IaC, Kubernetes, or CI/CD conventions until those technologies are actually present.
- Treat these recommendations as guidance, not historical decisions; replace them with observed project conventions as the repository evolves.

## Documentation

- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and route-oriented.
- Reference authoritative docs instead of copying them.
- Keep `TASKS.md` current-state only and `HANDOFF.md` operational, not a chat transcript.
- Treat `LEARNINGS.md` as a bounded, append-only buffer; promote durable learnings into `CONVENTIONS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, or `VALIDATION.md` instead of letting them accumulate.
- Keep tool-specific files as thin adapters that only route to `AGENTS.md`; record their paths in `.ai/ADAPTERS.md`.
- Keep the Resume block in `HANDOFF.md` current as a rolling checkpoint and honor the thresholds in `.ai/LIMITS.md`.
- Keep decision records (ADR/TDR) and requirements (PRD) separate: decisions describe technical choices, PRDs describe product scope. Choose simple or scale mode for decisions at adoption.
- Only the primary agent writes `HANDOFF.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `LEARNINGS.md`; subagents report back instead of committing shared state, to avoid concurrent writes to the single source of truth.
